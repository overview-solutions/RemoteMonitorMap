The project will provide water services for 210 households, of which 23 households will receive electricity services, as well as 7 community centers, serving a total of 970 people directly. Services will be paid by their users based on consumption, and the systems will be operated and maintained by a partnership between Monte Adentro and a local solar PV cooperative. The main outcomes are to improve household living conditions, strengthen food security and agriculture, and create professional opportunities through productive uses of the new services."

IEEE Smart Village partners with the Sirona Cares Foundation, which, in 2011, began deploying IEEE Smart Village community charging stations. The partner franchises local entrepreneurs in rural communities of Haiti, who then lease portable battery kits to homeowners for lighting and cell phone charging. The SunBlazer was found to be able to support lighting for up to 83 homes in a community, and the monthly fee to the homeowner is less than the cost of candles and kerosene (and/or fuel to run small generators), making electric home lighting easily affordable to people making $1-2 per day. In this way, With the franchise model, the only upfront investment required of the customer is a 2-month security deposit of $12.50 USD for the battery kit.
In June 2011 Sirona Cares initially deployed renewable-energy solutions in six villages and expanded to 15 villages in 2012 serving 1200 homes or 7200 people. After that, Sirona Cares expanded to serve another 2,200 homes reaching an estimated 20,000 people. At that time, 10 more homeowners joined the waiting list to receive portable battery kits for every home that was lit. Leveraging IEEE Smart Village’s initial seed funding and business model, Sirona Cares was able to attract additional funding of $1 million from international donors to expand its capacity by a factor of three.

There is a rich diversity of population, home to unique ethnic communities that have lived inside and along the Tarai forest belt that runs on both sides of the Indian-Nepalese border. Substantial farming in these tribal villages is unable to provide meaningful employment, other alternatives of livelihood are needed. Access to electricity is challenging and gets worse in the forest areas where a large percentage of the population is completely off-grid 

This social enterprise is focused on improving living standards, delivering quality education, creating entrepreneurs and job opportunities, and will further reach out to government and other social welfare programs. The profits from this endeavor will be reinvested into the program, and a larger involvement of the community will be pursued. This Project shall result in two pilot installations affecting a community of approx. 3,000 people or more, in the community of Nasir-Kishanpur and Pernia-Surma.
