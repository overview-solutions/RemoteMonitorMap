IEEE Smart Village partners with the Sirona Cares Foundation, which, in 2011, began deploying IEEE Smart Village community charging stations. The partner franchises local entrepreneurs in rural communities of Haiti, who then lease portable battery kits to homeowners for lighting and cell phone charging. The SunBlazer was found to be able to support lighting for up to 83 homes in a community, and the monthly fee to the homeowner is less than the cost of candles and kerosene (and/or fuel to run small generators), making electric home lighting easily affordable to people making $1-2 per day. In this way, With the franchise model, the only upfront investment required of the customer is a 2-month security deposit of $12.50 USD for the battery kit.\nIn June 2011 Sirona Cares initially deployed renewable-energy solutions in six villages and expanded to 15 villages in 2012 serving 1200 homes or 7200 people. After that, Sirona Cares expanded to serve another 2,200 homes reaching an estimated 20,000 people. At that time, 10 more homeowners joined the waiting list to receive portable battery kits for every home that was lit. Leveraging IEEE Smart Village�s initial seed funding and business model, Sirona Cares was able to attract additional funding of $1 million from international donors to expand its capacity by a factor of three.\n"
